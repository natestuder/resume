{\emph{Electrical Engineer} \\
Served as an embedded engineer at an engineering services firm.  A highly rated and flexible team member with the ability to quickly acclimate to new tasks.  Utilized across all disciplines of embedded engineering.  
\\
\\
Completed master degree program while working full time at this position.
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical Lead on a project to develop an DO-178B/C certified Open Source ARINC653 Operating System using Linux and Xen.
\begin{itemize}
\item Co-Maintained the arinc653 real-time scheduler in Xen.
\item Developed InterPartition Communication (IPC) Software for use in a Linux Operating System running on top of the Xen hypervisor.
\item Implemented ARINC653 RS232 and CAN IPC drivers.
\item Ported and demoed Xen on a military radio platform based on an ARM processor without virtualization extensions.
\item Wrote the DO-178C planning documents for the project using an innovative Agile/Waterfall hybrid process framework, which utilized Agile methods to increase the frequency of Stage Of Involvement (SOI) audits and avoid costly rework in late stages of certification.
\item Extended RMTOO to create a custom requirements management solution.
\item Developed DO-178C requirement and design artifacts for the Interpartition Communication Software and the Event Channel feature of Xen.
\item Classified data objects/types in order to perform a semi-formal data flow security analysis of Xen.
\end{itemize}
\item Safety Critical Software Engineering
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed software drivers and application interfaces for SPI, I2C, UART, SMBus, EEPROM, and FLASH devices for a smart battery application used in a medical setting.
\item Emulated the electrical behavior of an aircraft fan assembly using a PIC microprocessor.
\item Requirements management and requirements traceability as well as architecture definition and design for the VxWorks 653 board support package of a custom commercial aerospace CPU architecture in use on the Boeing 787.  This development was certified to DO-178B level A standards.  The system included multiple hardware and software redundancies.
\item Resolved PRs for the BSP and AFDX drivers of a commercial aerospace OS.
\item Performed object code analysis, to provide DO-178B evidence of source to object traceability.
\item Developed and ran requirements based testing for the AFDX, BSP, HMON, and FileSystem components of a commercial aerospace OS.
\item Developed and ran robustness testing software for a Jettison and Interlock military aerospace system.
\item Created drivers and board support package for several custom aviation computer architectures based on the VxWorks and VxWorks 653 operating system.  Drivers included DMA, VME, PCI, SPI, Ethernet, RS-232/422/485, and HDLC.
\item Ported several VxWorks board support packages to an equivalent VxWorks 653 board support packages.
\item Developed the software for a custom DSP board, which was used to verify the operation of the National Instrument test harness.  The software was developed separately from the production software to meet DO-178B’s independence criteria.
\item Developed a test application to verify the functionality of a TCP/IP stack to relevant Request For Comments (RFCs).
